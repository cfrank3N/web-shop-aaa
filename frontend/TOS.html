        <p class="tos-section-content"><strong>2.4.</strong> "Third-Party Services" refers to services or products provided by entities other than The Store, which may be accessible through links or integrations on our website.

    </section>

    <!-- User Eligibility Section -->
    <section>
        <h2 class="tos-section-title">3. User Eligibility</h2>
        <p class="tos-section-content">3.1. You must be at least 18 years of age, or the age of majority in your jurisdiction, to use our Services. If you are under the age of majority, please consult a guardian, as we cannot and will not offer any legal or parental advice. It is also your responsibility to ensure that any purchases or services obtained through the website comply with local laws and regulations.</p>
        <p class="tos-section-content">3.2. You must also ensure that you are capable of entering into a legally binding contract under the laws applicable to you. If you are uncertain, consider consulting a lawyer, a trusted adult, or a very wise owl. This contract is enforceable under the law, and if you are unable to comply with these Terms for any reason, you may not use our Services.</p>
        <p class="tos-section-content">3.3. If you access our Services on behalf of a business or entity, you represent that you are authorized to bind such business or entity to these Terms, and any references to "You" in these Terms will also refer to such business or entity.</p>

You may register by providing your name, email address, phone number, billing address, and other required information. If you choose to provide this information, you agree that it will be truthful and accurate, and that you will promptly update your account information when any changes occur. By registering an account, you agree to receive communication from us, including promotional emails, service-related updates, and transaction confirmations.</p>
        <p class="tos-section-content">4.2. Please ensure that the password you select is complex enough to withstand both the most casual and serious of cyberattacks. A combination of lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and special characters is highly recommended. Additionally, remember to avoid using easy-to-guess words like "password123" or "iloveyou" (unless you are, in fact, a character in a cheesy romantic novel, in which case, please disregard this advice). We also recommend using a password manager to securely store and generate strong passwords.</p>
        <p class="tos-section-content">4.3. You are solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account credentials, including your username and password. You agree to notify us immediately if you suspect any unauthorized access or usage of your account. Alternatively, you could take immediate action and change your password yourself. The choice is yours. Please note that we are not responsible for any loss or damage arising from your failure to protect your account credentials.</p>
        <p class="tos-section-content">4.4. In the event that your account becomes inactive or you violate these Terms, we reserve the right to suspend or terminate your account at our discretion. In such cases, any outstanding transactions or obligations must still be fulfilled, and you may be required to pay any outstanding balances before regaining access to our services.</p>
